# Exercise 1: Create a Deep Learning Model for image classification in PyTorch with CIFAR-10 dataset

## Objective

Develop a model that can classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset

Then try a model with convolutional layers
Create an evaluate.py file that evaluates the model and calculates and stores the evaluation metrics including a confusion matrix


Compare this method with previous one (previous exercise)
Whats the effect of data augmentation?

Compare both methods and discuss the differences

### Discussion of the results

How the model solves the problem?
Is there overfitting, underfitting or any other issues? 
How can we improve the model?
How this model will generalize to new data?

## Design Feedback loops

Describe the process you have followed to improve the model and the evolution of performance of the model during the process.

You can include a table stating the chanched parameters and the obtained results after the process.


## Questions

Pleaser answer the following questions. Include graphs if necessary. Store the graphs in the `outs/exercise_03` folder.

### Which are the differences you found between previous model and this one?

### Does the model generalizes well to new data?
