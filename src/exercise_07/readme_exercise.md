# Exercise 1: Create a Deep Learning Model for defibrillation detection from ECG in PyTorch 
## Objective

Develop a model that can classify deffibrillation from ECG

First, please, unzip the file data/ecg/cut_pub_4sec.zip and add it to git LFS:
git lfs track data/ecg/**

Try to create a model that can classify deffibrillation from ECG but using LSTM or GRU and their combinations with CNNs.

### Discussion of the results

How the model solves the problem?
Is there overfitting, underfitting or any other issues? 
How can we improve the model?
How this model will generalize to new data?

## Design Feedback loops

Describe the process you have followed to improve the model and the evolution of performance of the model during the process.

You can include a table stating the chanched parameters and the obtained results after the process.


## Questions

Pleaser answer the following questions. Include graphs if necessary. Store the graphs in the `outs/exercise_03` folder.

### Which are the differences you found between previous model and this one?

### Does the model generalizes well to new data?
