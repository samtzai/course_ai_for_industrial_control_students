## Section 1: Theoretical Understanding (40 points)

### 1.1 Classification Fundamentals (20 points)

**Question 1** (5 points): What is the primary goal of the wine quality classification tutorial?
- a) To predict wine prices based on quality
- b) To classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties for industrial quality control
- c) To identify wine grape varieties
- d) To predict wine aging potential

**Question 2** (5 points): The wine quality dataset uses a quality scale from:
- a) 1-5
- b) 0-10
- c) 3-9
- d) 1-10

**Question 3** (5 points): What type of loss function is used for the multi-class wine quality classification?
- a) Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- b) Binary Cross-Entropy
- c) Cross-Entropy Loss with class weights
- d) Hinge Loss

**Question 4** (5 points): For industrial quality control, wines with quality scores â‰¥6 are considered:
- a) Poor quality
- b) Average quality
- c) Acceptable/High quality
- d) Premium quality only

### 1.2 Neural Network Architecture (20 points)

**Question 5** (5 points): Which preprocessing technique is essential for neural networks in this classification task?
- a) One-hot encoding
- b) Feature standardization/scaling
- c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Section 2: Practical Applications (25 points)

### 2.1 Industrial Implementation (25 points)

**Question 9** (15 points): Explain why class weighting is important in this wine quality classification problem. How is it calculated and what problem does it solve?

**Question 10** (10 points): The model shows that 'alcohol content' and 'volatile acidity' are the most important features for quality prediction. However, a domain expert argues that 'pH' should be more important. How would you investigate this discrepancy and what might explain it?

_Your answer:_

## Section 3: Critical Thinking (15 points)

### 3.1 Model Evaluation and Improvement (15 points)

**Question 11** (15 points): You're implementing this wine quality classification system in a real winery. The production team needs to make binary decisions (accept/reject) based on your multi-class model predictions. Design a decision-making strategy that considers both the predicted quality class and the model's confidence. Include potential actions for uncertain predictions.
